TRMM folder contains precip data

1. Separate into train+test data
2. Saave TRMM Precp dataset locally as aanother file so we can save memory? Same with Elnino + DMI
3. For the SNHT, run it on the entire array? i.e 13x11 different iterations and on daily data from 19980101 to 20191230.
	Plot a frequency distribution graph?
	If there are values of T(y) where T(y)>9.95, isolate them.


Now should have TRMM, DMI, NINO all in same weeks:
4. Run Cross Corelation of DMI + the 4 Ninos against each other. 
Plot into table
