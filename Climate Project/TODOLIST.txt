# ClimateProject
TRMM folder contains precip data

1. Separate into train+test data
2. For the SNHT, run it on the entire array? i.e 13x11 different iterations and on weekly data from 19980101 to 20191230.
	Plot a frequency distribution graph?
	If there are values of T(y) where T(y)>9.95, isolate them.


Now should have TRMM, DMI, NINO all in same weeks:
3. Run Cross Corelation of DMI + the 4 Ninos against each other. (Coded up Pearlson, just need to run it)
4. Run on precipitation vs climate indices
Plot into table
