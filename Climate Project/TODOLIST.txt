# ClimateProject
TRMM folder contains precip data

DONE:


1. Separate into train+test data
2. For the SNHT, run it on the entire array? i.e 13x11 different iterations and on weekly data from 19980101 to 20191230. 
	Plot a frequency distribution graph?
	If there are values of T(y) where T(y)>9.95, isolate them.

ToDO;
3. Run Pearlson-correlation test between each rainfall gridpoint and (DMI, nino12, nino3, nino3.4, nino4). Run from timelag of 0 weeks to 26 weeeks.

4. Isolate statistically significant climate indices for each rainfall gridpoint. For example, for gridpoint (3, 4), the DMI and nino12 are the 
only significant correlations, then we run SARIMAX of precipitation on that gridpoint using DMI and nino12 as the only "exogenous factors".
